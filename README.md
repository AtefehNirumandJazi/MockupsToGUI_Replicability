# Replicability Package for Mockups to GUI Generation

This repository contains the data required to replicate the results presented in our paper, "From Mock-Ups to IFML-like Models: Leveraging Large Language Models for Web Engineering."

## Structure
- **Input_Data**: Contains the 100 CodePen links and corresponding input data (UI mock-up images) used in the study.
- **Output_Data**: Contains the 100 GUI models generated by our approach.
